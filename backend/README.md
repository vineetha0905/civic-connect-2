# CivicConnect Backend API

A comprehensive Node.js/Express backend for the CivicConnect civic issue reporting platform.

## 🚀 Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based auth with OTP verification

## 🧭 Implementation Flow (Non-Technical)

1. Citizen registers with Name, Aadhaar (12 digits), Mobile (10 digits), and Address (or uses current location to autofill).
2. For login, citizen enters Aadhaar and receives a one‑time password (OTP).
3. Citizen enters the OTP; if correct and on time, access is granted.
4. If the mobile/Aadhaar was seen before, the existing account is upgraded with the new details instead of being blocked.
5. Admins use their own login to view, assign, and track issue resolutions.

- **Issue Management**: Create, update, track civic issues with location data
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.io for live notifications
- **File Upload**: Cloudinary integration for images and documents
- **Admin Dashboard**: Complete admin panel with analytics
- **Notifications**: Email and in-app notifications
- **Multi-language Support**: Ready for internationalization
- **Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, input validation
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- Cloudinary account (for file uploads)
- SMTP credentials (for email notifications)
